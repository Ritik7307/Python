A function is a blok of code that performs a specific task whenver it is called . IN bigger programs, where we have large amounts of code, it is advisable to create or use existing functions that make the program flow organised and neat.

## 2 types:
1. Built-in-function
2. User-defined functions

<Built-in function: min(),max(),len(),type(),range(),dict(),list(), tuple(),set(), print()>

<User-defined Function: we can create them to perform specific tasks as per our needs>
